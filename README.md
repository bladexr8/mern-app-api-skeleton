# mern-app-api-skeleton
Simple backend API Skeleton for MERN stack based on the Packt Book "Full Stack React Projects - Second Edition".

**Note:** this repository started as a clone of the mern-app-skeleton repository but has been re-factored to be a backend API only, without the webpack hot reloading which causes issues
